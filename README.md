# NeonMob Enhancer

Enhancing NeonMob with a Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension will show the % of Free Packs claimed and the % of packs available when you are viewing any given set's checklist page.

## History
It was mentioned that there was a NeonMob API available with information that wasn't shown about sets. I figured why
not try out a Chrome extension. Currently it is in HEAVILY development meaning, it might disappear if NeonMob doesn't like it.
There are probably already plans in place to show this information, but maybe this can be a stepping stone to show what people want.
