# NeonMob Enhancer

Enhancing NeonMob with a Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension will show the % of Free Packs claimed and the % of packs available when you are viewing any given set's checklist page.

## History
It was mentioned that there was a NeonMob API available with information that wasn't shown about sets. I figured why
not try out a Chrome extension. 

## Currently it is in HEAVILY development.

## TODO
